  <p>The school principal in NIS tries to help all the children at NIS and to keep them up and not leave them behind. The Principal always sees if we are
     focusing well and is sharp and detailed when hearing about us from the teachers. The School Principal also teaches us, teaches us in an unique way. She let's us have fun and fun is also a way to make us be participating. If a student joins NIS at Grade 5, 4, 6, 7, or 8, the Principal always shows the new student around and doesn't leave the new student lonely or left out. 
     All thanks to the school staff, students, teachers, and School Principal, the first top Islamic School in Ontario curriculum is NIS. Ever since NIS (1995) was made, the School Principal changed. From the beginning to now the School Principals were so charming and so nice.
    Everyone in NIS misses the old principal(s). Now it might be the time to say bye to this one too. Without all of the school Principals, us students would never get ahead... -Aroush</p>

  <p>I kinda don't like the Library (not because it has books...), because I can't find the genre and the type of books I want!
    --Every type of book in the library doesn't have the books I want to read and in the library -- I can't find the time to get there, in break time we would go in reccess and I just also really want to do reccess too --- ... But, I still can enjoy a book from the library in class, with my classmates (I guess that also be nice..) -Aroush

    Dear Student,

    Those are my rights, which are fundamental and essential. No one can deprive me of those
    rights. However, they are restricted because I am not alone on earth and because I need the
    others to help me to flourish as well as the others need me to flourish and be enlightened.

    Consequences will be determined by the nature and frequency of the incident. All the staff
    members of the school have the right to intervene. Depending on the infraction, five levels of
    intervention are possible. If a student continues to offend, or if no change is noticed, we pass to
    the next level.</p>
